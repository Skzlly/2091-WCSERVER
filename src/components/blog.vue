    <p>As you enter the Summoner’s Rift, you’ll need to learn the basics of it first. 
    League of Legends is a premade 5v5 competitive multiplayer online battle arena game where you can go against other people to show them who’s stronger. It has a champion pool where you can choose and play around 157 champions with different abilities and playstyles. With different champions and various skill sets, League of Legends offers six classes to play: Assassin, Fighter, Mage, Marksman, Support, and Tank.
    Its gameplay revolves around how you and your team earn gold to buy items that can help you build and become stronger so that you can kill the enemy team, push towers, and destroy the enemy nexus.
    With that being said, the longer the game, the more thrilling and complex it becomes. It depends on how you play your champ and duel with your opponent, and how you build your items. With so much happening and the overall thrill and excitement, it just makes League of Legends more fun.</p>

    <p> As you can see in the map, there are three lanes: the top lane, mid lane, and bottom lane. There are five roles to play: top, jungle, mid, bot, and support. Different tasks and play styles are associated with these roles. The top lane role mainly uses champions here, like tanky or fighter champions. Jungle role here, you need a spell called smite, which you use to kill jungle camp monsters and to get objectives prior notice; only use smite when you are tasked to be in a jungler role. The mid-lane role uses champions such as mages and assassins; their primary role is basically to become a killing machine, maintain towers up, or kill or target enemy bot carry when using assassin champs when or before team fights begin. The bot role uses marksman champions, which are squishy champions but deal a lot of damage when played properly, and when played properly, it ends as bot carry. The bot’s primary role is to farm for gold, avoid dying to enemy players, and deal a ton of damage. Lastly, support roles, which use mage or support champions but focus more on low-based magic damage and more on healing and protecting, need to protect their adc, also known as an attack damage carry, as their primary role, which indicates the bot role.</p>

    <p>Riot Games also gives players who have played well or became the most valuable player (MVP) of the game rewards. Not only by becoming the MVP will you get rewards, but you’ll also get them by finishing missions. With these rewards, such as a chest and key, you can open them to get skin shards, which you can get in exchange for orange essence.</p>
