    <p>Hello Gamers! I am Louis Jae Garcia, also known as Skzlly, which is my in-game name (IGN). I am a college student studying at Holy Angel University. I love playing video games and am a big fan of MOBA and FPS games. This is website is about League of Legends and my review on it, I've been playing this game for 6 years and I did a Review on it. I play a lot of different games, so feel free to add me, hit me up with suggestions, and letâ€™s play some games!</p>
